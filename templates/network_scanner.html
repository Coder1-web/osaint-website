    <h1>Network Scanner</h1>
    <div class="content">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            A network scanner is a tool used to discover devices on a network, identify active IP addresses, and gather information about networked systems. Network scanners are essential for network management, security assessments, and troubleshooting network issues. This document will provide a comprehensive overview of network scanners, their functionalities, and their applications.
        </p>

        <h2>Types of Network Scanners</h2>
        <p>
            There are several types of network scanners, each serving different purposes. Key types include port scanners, vulnerability scanners, and ping scanners. Port scanners identify open ports on devices, vulnerability scanners assess systems for known vulnerabilities, and ping scanners detect active devices on the network.
        </p>

        <h2>Common Network Scanning Tools</h2>
        <p>
            This section explores popular network scanning tools, including Nmap, Angry IP Scanner, and Advanced IP Scanner. Each tool's features, usage, and advantages will be discussed in detail.
        </p>

        <h2>Basic Scanning Techniques</h2>
        <p>
            Understanding basic scanning techniques is crucial for effective network scanning. This section covers techniques such as ping sweeps, port scans, and service enumeration. Examples and explanations of these techniques will be provided.
        </p>

        <h2>Advanced Scanning Techniques</h2>
        <p>
            Advanced scanning techniques offer deeper insights into networked systems. This section includes topics such as OS fingerprinting, network mapping, and vulnerability assessment. Advanced techniques help identify detailed information about devices and potential security weaknesses.
        </p>

        <h2>Use Cases</h2>
        <p>
            Network scanners are used in various scenarios, including network inventory management, security assessments, and troubleshooting. Use cases will be discussed to highlight the importance of network scanning in maintaining and securing networks.
        </p>

        <h2>Security and Ethical Considerations</h2>
        <p>
            Security and ethics play a significant role in network scanning. This section discusses best practices for ethical scanning, legal considerations, and ensuring that network scanning activities do not disrupt network operations.
        </p>

        <h2>Resources and Further Reading</h2>
        <p>
            For further learning, various resources are available, including online guides, documentation, and community forums. Recommended resources for in-depth knowledge and troubleshooting will be provided.
